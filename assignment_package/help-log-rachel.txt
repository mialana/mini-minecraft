notes:

- bilinear interp: end of 4/11 lec

- think about how to check if you're underwater (not just if the BlockType at this position == WATER)
- maybe travel upwards until you hit either a full/ partial block or a water block?

- water is too dark
- improve bilinear interp fn to be more of a piecewise fn

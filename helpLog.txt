float perlin = PerlinZeroToOne();
float heightMix = glm::smoothstep(0.25, 0.75, perlin);

float height = glm::lerp(grasslandHeight, mountainHeight, heightMix);

questions:
1. Where should our terrain be created? (I currently have it in createTestScene())
2. Would it make sense to do barycentric interpolation but with 4 points (for 4 different domains)?
3. How would I add another block type for snow or sand?
